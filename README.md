# pcfdjango

Notes:

This was my first time using Django and python - I have used python for a couple quick one-off scripts but otherwise new to me.

I started the frontend first, and didn't realize Django had an opinionated way to integrate the frontend. I've used a similar injection method with PHP.

Django credentials leaked to git. Oh well!

To run the project

## in root directory

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver

## in frontend

npm install

npm run dev
